                    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                    <p>As technology continues to advance, computer science has become an increasingly popular field of study. 
                        It is a highly relevant and dynamic field that has the potential to solve complex problems, 
                        drive innovation, and inspire creativity. In this blog post, 
                        I will discuss the three reasons why I chose to study computer science:
                        <i>problem solving, innovation, and creativity.</i></p>

                    <br>
                    <p> &#x27A2; Computer science is all about finding solutions to real-world problems. 
                        Whether it is developing software that improves business operations or creating algorithms that can 
                        predict and prevent diseases, computer science plays a crucial role in problem-solving across 
                        a variety of industries</p>
                    <p>In the tech industry, computer scientists are responsible for developing applications, software, and 
                        systems that address various problems, from streamlining operations to increasing cybersecurity. 
                        In healthcare, computer scientists develop algorithms that help doctors and researchers analyze vast 
                        amounts of medical data to find patterns and develop new treatments.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p> &#x27A2; Innovation is at the heart of computer science. With new technologies emerging every day, computer 
                        scientists must be able to think creatively and adapt to change quickly. By constantly pushing the 
                        boundaries of what is possible, computer scientists have been able to create technologies that have 
                        changed the way we live and work.</p>
                        <p>From the creation of the internet to the development of smartphones, computer scientists have been 
                        responsible for many of the innovations that have transformed our world. In addition, computer 
                        scientists continue to innovate with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine 
                        learning, and quantum computing.</p>
